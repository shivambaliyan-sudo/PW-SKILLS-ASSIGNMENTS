    "### The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). A class defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: An instance of a class. Objects are the actual entities created using the class blueprint, and they can hold data and have methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps protect the data from being modified unintentionally by outside functions or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: A mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. More generally, it refers to the ability of different types of objects to respond to the same method call in a way that is appropriate for their class. It allows the same operation to behave differently on different classes."
