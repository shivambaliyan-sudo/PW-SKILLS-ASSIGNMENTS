        "### Why Multiprocessing is Used in Python Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Leveraging Multiple CPU Cores:\n",
        "\n",
        "True Parallelism: In modern computers, CPUs often have multiple cores. Multiprocessing allows Python programs to fully utilize these cores by running separate processes on each one. This leads to true parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: In a system with 4 cores, a multiprocessing program can run 4 independent tasks simultaneously, potentially leading to a 4x speedup for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Bypassing Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",
        "\n",
        "GIL and Multithreading: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on a multi-core processor. This limits the effectiveness of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks, as threads cannot truly run in parallel.\n",
        "Multiprocessing as a Solution: Since each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, multiprocessing bypasses the GIL, allowing multiple processes to run in parallel on separate CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Improving Performance for CPU-Bound Tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "CPU-Bound Tasks: These are tasks that require a significant amount of computation and are limited by the speed of the CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include complex mathematical calculations, data processing, and simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing for Speedup: By dividing the workload among multiple processes, a CPU-bound task can be completed faster, as each process works on a part of the task concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Isolation and Fault Tolerance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Process Isolation: Each process runs in its own memory space, meaning that a crash in one process doesn’t affect others.\n",
        "This isolation improves the robustness of applications.\n",
        "Fault Tolerance: If one process encounters an error or crashes, other processes can continue running, reducing the impact of failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Suitable for Certain Applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent Task Execution: Multiprocessing is ideal for applications where tasks can be divided into independent units of work,\n",
        "such as in parallel data processing, batch processing, or running independent simulations.\n",
        "\n",
